## Introduction<a id="introduction"></a>


The growth of philosophical interest in biology over the past forty years reflects the increasing prominence of the biological sciences in the same period. There is now an extensive literature on many different biological topics, and it would be impossible to summarise this body of work in this single entry. Instead, this entry sets out to explain what philosophy of biology is. Why does biology matter to philosophy and vice versa? A list of the entries in the encyclopedia which address specific topics in the philosophy of biology is provided at the end of the entry.

Three different kinds of philosophical inquiry fall under the general heading of philosophy of biology. First, general theses in the philosophy of science are addressed in the context of biology. Second, conceptual problems within biology itself are subjected to philosophical analysis. Third, appeals to biology are made in discussions of traditional philosophical questions.

Philosophy of biology can also be subdivided by the particular areas of the life sciences with which it is concerned. Biology is an extremely diverse set of disciplines, ranging from historical sciences such as paleontology to engineering sciences such as biotechnology. Different philosophical issues occur in each field. The latter part of the entry discusses how philosophers have approached some of the main disciplines within biology.

## Pre-history of Philosophy of Biology<a id="phopob"></a>

As is the case for most apparent novelties, closer inspection reveals a pre-history for the philosophy of biology [(Grene & Depew 2004)](#greenedepew). In the 1950s the biologist J. H. Woodger and the philosopher Morton Beckner both published major works on the philosophy of biology ([Woodger 1952](#woodger); [Beckner 1959](#beckner)), but these did not give rise to a subsequent philosophical literature (though see [Ruse 1988](#ruse)). Some philosophers of science also made claims about biology based on general epistemological and metaphysical considerations. One of the most famous examples is J. J. C. Smart’s claim that the biology is not an autonomous science, but a technological application of more basic sciences, like “radio-engineering” ([Smart 1959](#smart), 366). Like engineering, biology cannot make any addition to the laws of nature. It can only reveal how the laws of physics and chemistry play out in the context of particular sorts of initial and boundary conditions (for more recent discussions of biological laws, see [Beatty 1995](#beatty); [Brandon 1997](#brandon); [Mitchell 1997](#mitchell); [Sober 1997](#sober); [Waters 1998](#waters)). Even in 1969 the zoologist Ernst Mayr could complain that books with ‘philosophy of science’ in the title were all misleading and should be re-titled ‘philosophy of physics’ ([Mayr 1969](#mayr)). It is worth noting however that philosophers of science such as [Carl G. Hempel (1965)](#hempel) and [Ernest Nagel (1961)](#nagel) offered accounts of functional explanation as found in the biological sciences. The encouragement of prominent biologists such as Mayr and F. J. Ayala ([Ayala 1976](#ayala); [Mayr 1982](#mayr)) was one factor in the emergence of the new field. Another factor was that several philosophers of science including Robert Brandon, Phillip Kitcher, Elisabeth Lloyd, Sahotra Sarkar, Elliott Sober, and William C. Wimsatt did research at Harvard University with the likes of Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Lewontin, and Richard Levins ([Callebaut 1993](#callebaut)). The first sign of philosophy of biology becoming a mainstream part of philosophy of science was the publication of David Hull’s Philosophy of Biological Science in the prominent Prentice-Hall Foundations of Philosophy series ([Hull 1974](#hull)). From then on the field developed rapidly. Robert Brandon could say of the late 1970’s that “I knew five philosophers of biology: Marjorie Grene, David Hull, Michael Ruse, Mary Williams and William Wimsatt.” ([Brandon 1996](#brandon), xii–xiii) By 1986, however, there were more than enough to fill the pages of Michael Ruse’s new journal Biology and Philosophy. This trend has only increased with the introduction of additional journals such as Biological Theory, Philosophy and Practice of Biology, History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences, and Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences.

## Three Types of Philosophy of Biology<a id="ttopob"></a>

 Three different kinds of philosophical inquiry fall under the general heading of philosophy of biology. First, general theses in the philosophy of science are addressed in the context of biology. Second, conceptual (or theoretical) problems within biology itself are subjected to philosophical analysis. Third, appeals to biology are made in discussions of traditional philosophical questions. The first major debate in the philosophy of biology exemplified the first of these, the use of genetics to explore reductionism and anti-reductionism in the philosophy of science. Kenneth F. Schaffner applied the logical empiricist model of theory reduction to the relationship between classical, Mendelian genetics and molecular genetics ([Schaffner 1967a](#schaffner); [Schaffner 1967b](#schaffner); [Schaffner 1969](#schaffner)). David Hull argued that the lesson of this attempt was that Mendelian genetics is irreducible to molecular genetics ([Hull 1974](#hull); [Hull 1975](#hull)). This debate reinforced the near-consensus in the 1970s and 1980s that the special sciences are autonomous from the more fundamental sciences ([Fodor 1974](#fodor); [Kitcher 1984](#kitcher)). However, the apparent absurdity of the claim that the molecular revolution in biology was not a successful instance of scientific reduction also led the formulation of increasingly more adequate models of theory reduction ([Wimsatt 1976](#wimsatt); [Wimsatt 1980](#wimsatt); [Schaffner 1993](#schaffner); [Waters 1994](#waters); [Rosenberg 1997](#rosenberg); [Sarkar 1998](#sarkar)).

In another important early debate philosophers set out to solve a conceptual problem within biology itself. The concept of reproductive fitness is at the heart of evolutionary theory, but its status has always been problematic. It has proved surprisingly hard for biologists to avoid the criticism that, “\[i\]f we try to make laws of evolution in the strict sense we seem to reduce to tautologies. Thus suppose we say that even in Andromeda ‘the fittest will survive’ we say nothing, for ‘fittest’ has to be defined in terms of ‘survival’” ([Smart 1959](#smart), 366). This came to be know as the “tautology problem”. Alexander Rosenberg and Mary B. Williams argued that fitness is an irreducible primitive which derives its meaning from its place in an axiomatic formulation of evolutionary theory ([Rosenberg 1983](#rosenberg); [Sober 1984a](#sober); [Williams and Rosenberg 1985](#williamsandrosenberg)). If correct, this would solve the tautology problem since axioms are often thought of as tautologous. In the 1970’s the new generation of philosophers of biology offered a different solution to the tautology problem in two steps. First, they began by arguing that fitness is a supervenient property of organisms: the fitness of each particular organism is necessarily dependent on some specific set of physical characteristics of the organism and its particular environment, but two organisms that have the same fitness may do so in virtue very different sets of physical characteristics ([Rosenberg 1978](#rosenberg)). Second, they argued that this supervenient property is a propensity – which is a probabilistic disposition represented by a probability distribution over possible numbers of offspring ([Mills and Beatty 1979](#millsandbeatty)). Although fitness is defined in terms of reproductive success, it is not a tautology that the fittest organisms have the most offspring, any more than it is a tautology that dice produce even numbers more often than they produce sixes. The propensities of fit organisms to survive and of dice to fall equally often on each side both allow us to make fallible predictions about what will happen, predictions that become more reliable as the size of the sample increases. It remains unclear, however, whether it is possible to specify a probability distribution or set of distributions that can play all the roles actually played by fitness in population biology ([Beatty & Finsen 1989](#beattyfinsen), [Sober 2001](#sober); [Pence & Ramsey 2013](#penceramsey)).

The phrase ‘conceptual problems’ should be understood very broadly. The conceptual work done by philosophers of biology in many cases merges smoothly into theoretical biology. It also sometimes leads philosophers to examine and criticize the chains of argument constructed by biologists, and thus to enter directly into ongoing biological debates. In the same way, the first kind of philosophy of biology we have described – the use of biological examples to work through general issues in the philosophy of science – sometimes feeds back into biology itself through specific recommendations for improving biological methodology. It is a striking feature of the philosophy of biology literature that philosophers often publish in biology journals and that biologists often contribute to philosophy of biology journals. The philosophy of biology also has a potentially important role as a mediator between biology and society. Popular representations of biology derive broad lessons from large swathes of experimental findings and theoretical work. Philosophers of science have an obvious role in evaluating these interpretations of the significance of specific biological findings ([Stotz and Griffiths 2008](#stotzgriffiths)). As two important examples, philosophers of biology have provided a great deal of clarity regarding creationism/intelligent design ([Kitcher 1982](#kitcher); [Ruse 1982](#ruse); Pennock 2000 [CAN'T FIND ANYTHING]; [Sarkar 2007](#sarkar)) and sociobiology/evolutionary psychology ([Kitcher 1985](#kitcher); [Buller 2006](#buller); [Richardson 2010](#richardson); [Barker 2015](#barker)).

A third form of philosophy of biology occurs when philosophers appeal to biology to support positions on traditional philosophical topics, such as ethics or epistemology. The extensive literature on biological teleology is a case in point. After a brief flurry of interest in the wake of the “modern synthesis”, during which the term ‘teleonomy’ was introduced to denote the specifically evolutionary interpretation of teleological language ([Pittendrigh 1958](#pittendrigh)), the ideas of function and goal directedness came to be regarded as relatively unproblematic by evolutionary biologists. In the 1970s, however, philosophers started to look to biology to provide a solid, scientific basis for normative concepts, such as illness, disorder, or malfunction ([Wimsatt 1972](#wimsatt); [Wright 1973](#wright); [Boorse 1976](#boorse)). Eventually, the philosophical debate produced an analysis of teleological language fundamentally similar to the view associated with modern synthesis ([Millikan 1984](#millikan); [Neander 1991](#neander); Godfrey-Smith 1994 CAN'T FIND ANYTHING). According to the “selected effects” theory of function, the functions of a trait are those activities in virtue of which the trait was selected. The idea of proper function has become part of the conceptual toolkit of philosophy in general and of the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind in particular ([Dretske 1991, 1997](#dretske); [Millikan 1995, 2004, 2005](#millikan)); [Papineau 1987, 1993](#papineau); [Neander 2017](#neander); [Garson 2019](#garson)).

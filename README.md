# What This Project Is

This project is to convert [this](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/biology-philosophy/) document into a markdown file.

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a lightweight plaintext file format that allows for things like basic formatting, internal and external links, and embedded images.

Markdown was chosen as a format because all of these factors mean that it is easy to both create, use, and parse these files, which could in theory allow for one to very easily do meta-analyses of papers, and give more convenient access to citations and references.

The (still a WIP) markdown file of the review paper is the only other document in this repository.
